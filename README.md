My personal website 

It contains all the different types of JS work like animations, transitions, slideshow built using JS etc. 
This website is not my official website and the content (like my acedamics and bio) is valid but acts mostly as a placeholder.

It's not yet fully optimized for mobile devices but still usable. 
The main tools I used were Bootstrap and jQuery.
